# PHP - MySQL Tutorial
The tutorial about basic usage of PHP and MySQL. This is a tutorial for AMDP Training which was held on Oct 24th, 2016.

In this tutorial, I provided PHP code for basic CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) combined with MySQL database. The codes are written in English and Bahasa.


## Get Started
1. Clone this repo or Download ZIP file
2. Move all files to htdocs directory (I'm using XAMPP on Windows)
2. Configure the connection to database in _connect.php_ file
3. Run Apache webserver and MySQL service 
4. Setup the DB (my DB name: _amdptraining_) and create table _"msbarang"_
4. Open the page in browser using http://localhost:xxxx/folder_name/list_barang.php (use your own port number)
5. Done!

## What to do next?
- Play around with some built-in PHP MySQL function
- Read the PHP docs
- Learn the PHP best practice
- Create your own case (or maybe create a simple mini blog for your site)
- Enjoy!
